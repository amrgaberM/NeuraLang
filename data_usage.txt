Absolutely — here’s a **complete, professional data usage plan** for your NeuraLang project, in a clean **text + table format** that you can copy and paste directly. This shows which dataset to use at each stage, and whether to start small or scale up.

# **NeuraLang Data Usage Plan**

This plan guides which dataset to use for each stage of NeuraLang, balancing **learning, demonstration, and portfolio professionalism**.

* **Small/Internal Data**: Tiny, manageable datasets for fast experimentation, visualization, and understanding concepts.
* **Large/External Data**: Realistic, larger datasets for meaningful metrics, performance evaluation, and production-ready demos.
* **Strategy**: Start with small datasets for clarity; optionally scale up to large datasets for realistic experiments.

### **Usage Notes**

1. **Start small**: Always begin with `tiny_corpus.py` or other internal datasets to make outputs readable and iterations fast.
2. **Scale up**: Replace or augment with large datasets when demonstrating **realistic performance, fine-tuning, or vector search**.
3. **Portfolio-ready notebooks**:

   * Show small dataset results for clarity.
   * Optionally include a “scaled-up experiment” section with external datasets for professional depth.
4. **Maintain modularity**: Each stage should only import the dataset needed for that task.

This plan ensures your project is **reproducible, educational, and portfolio-ready**, while also showing your capability to scale to real-world data.

If you want, I can **also make a simple “dataset import snippet”** for each notebook so you can copy-paste it — it will automatically load **small for demo, optionally large for real experiments**.

Do you want me to do that next?
